This Repository and the Guide as a whole is meant to be a Community Project.
If you find something worth sharing, like some tips how to get a specific Game to run or just want to correct my terrible English, you are welcome to fork this Repository and set over a Pull Request.

There are only a few rules I would like to ask you to follow:

1.  Guides should be written in an easy way. Everybody should be able to follow them.  
Assume that people who read this never touched Linux in their entire life.

2. Use Screenshots in Addition to your Guides if possible.  
Seeing everything done is vital for someone who is new to something.

3. No guides that are Video Only. A Video Tutorial should always be supplementary.  
There has to be a written part as well.

4. Keep it clean and nice. Every Issue can be addressed here.  
That means no Anti-Alternative Launcher BS, please.



The File Structure of the Guide also has a few rules:

1. Images, Videos and other Files should be placed under /img in a folder with the same name as your markdown file.  
No external Images please as these are prone to vanishing.

2. Your Markdown File should be placed in under /pages in its corresponding category folder.

3. A Link to the Markdown file has to be placed under the "Index" Section of the README in its corresponding Category.

If all of this is taken into consideration, your pull-request will surely be approved.
